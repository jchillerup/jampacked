# JAMPACKED
JAMPACKED is a system for recording tunes directly in your browser and sharing them with your friends so they can practice by ear between jam sessions.

## Ideas
* Inbuilt tuner using [PitchDetect](https://github.com/cwilso/pitchdetect)
* Wiki-like
* It should be possible to just record the tune without adding *any* metadata
* Would be nice with a comment box that would also allow recording variations
* A DB scheme with more than one video per tune
